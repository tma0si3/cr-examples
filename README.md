# Examples for the Bosch IoT Central Registry cloud service

This repository contains examples for using the Bosch IoT Central Registry in the cloud.

## Example "inventory-browser"

This example shows how to create a simple user interface to list things and their details and show the things on a map.

## Example "postman-collection"

This is a list of prepared REST call examples to demonstrate typical usages of the REST APIs.

The provided files can be used in Google Chrome browser extension "Postman". This extension can be downloaded here: <https://www.getpostman.com/>

## Example "cr-integration-api-examples"

This example shows how to use the CR-Integration Client for Java.

## Example "things-rest-angular""

Implements a simple web application with angular.js and bootstrap to show how to use the ThingsService Rest Api with JavaScript.

### Configuration

The application will be hosted in Cloud Foundry using staticfile as buildpack. Deployment is preconfigured in the manifest.yml

```
---
applications:
- name: craas-things-example
  memory: 64M
  buildpack: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/staticfile-buildpack.git
```

To avoid CORS (Cross-Origin resource sharing) issues, the nginx configuration will use an internal proxy to redirect the rest calls to the ThingsService. Inside the application, the api could therefore be called from /cr.

```
location /cr {
	proxy_pass https://cr.apps.bosch-iot-cloud.com/cr/1;
}
```

### Deployment

To deploy the application to Cloud Foundry, we use staticfile as buildpack. Execute the following commands from a shell in the application root folder.

* ```cf login``` to configure your cloud foundry login
* ```cf push``` to deploy the application
